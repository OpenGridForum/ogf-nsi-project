#summary Living list of NSI error codes for standardization.

= Introduction =

The NSI ServiceException structure is designed to return detailed error information in the event of an operation failure.  This structure can be returned as a SOAP fault in response to the initial request message, or in the message contents of the operation's Failed response.

The following elements are defined as members of the ServiceException:

 * nsaId - NSA that generated the service exception.

 * errorId - Error identifier uniquely identifying each known fault within the protocol.

 * text - User friendly message text describing the error.

 * variables - A collection of type/value pairs providing addition information relating to the error.

 * childException - Heirarchical list of service exceptions capturing failures withing the request tree.

= Error Codes =

NSI uses a hierarchal error code structure to group related error codes together under a common parent error code value.  For example, the following table demonstrates the generic SECURITY_ERROR parent code and two more specific children security related error codes.

|| text || errorId ||
|| SECURITY_ERROR || 00300 ||
|| UNAUTHORIZED || 00301 ||
|| AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE || 00302 ||

If we introduce a new security error code, then the next value would be 00303.  An implementation that does not yet support the new error code can, at the very least, determine it is a  SECURITY_ERROR.

The following are a list of standardized error codes to be supported within ServiceException:

|| text || errorId || description || variables ||
|| PAYLOAD_ERROR || 00100 || || ||
|| MISSING_PARAMETER || 00101 || Invalid or missing parameter || Include the parameter name that is missing. ||
|| UNSUPPORTED_PARAMETER || 00102 || Parameter provided contains an unsupported value which MUST be processed. || Include the parameter name that is unsupported. ||
|| NOT_IMPLEMENTED || 00103 ||  || Include the capability that is not implemented. ||
|| VERSION_NOT_SUPPORTED || 00104 || The service version requested in NSI header is not supported. || Return type protocolVersion and value the version requested. ||
|| CONNECTION_ERROR || 00200 || || ||
|| INVALID_TRANSITION || 00201 || Connection state machine is in invalid state for received message. || Include the current state of the state machine. ||
|| CONNECTION_EXISTS || 00202 || Schedule already exists for connectionId || ||
|| CONNECTION_NONEXISTENT || 00203 || Schedule does not exists for connectionId. || ||
|| CONNECTION_GONE || 00204 || || ||
